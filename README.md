# Blockchain based Vaccination Passport using Self-sovereign identity with Hyperledger technology 

Generally, Health records are kept in disparate but centralised database systems. These systems are vulnerable to data theft, cyber-attacks, fraud, blackmailing, and many other privacy issues. In addition to that, users of these systems need to maintain multiple user accounts and they donâ€™t have any control over their data stored in these systems. In this paper, we will evaluate the usability of blockchain technologies for vendor-neutral decentralised identity management, access controls, and costs effective platforms to build a portable, user-centred tamper-proof vaccination passport that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

Notes:

Adds --auto-store-credential to the demo Alice agents


## This is a Web Application Artefact developed to orchestrate Passport Issuer, Holder, and Verifier credential exchange scenarios

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Starting Agents:



1) Checkout GITHUB project:

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python.git

2) cd demo

3) Start Faber, Alice , Acme in seperate Tabs 

4) start agents in seperate tabs

tab1) LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber --events --no-auto --bg

tab2) LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber --events --no-auto --bg

tab3 ) LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber --events --no-auto --bg

5) check logs in each tab: 

tab1) docker logs faber
tab2) docker logs alice
tab3) docker logs acme

6) open swaggers: 

faber
http://localhost:8021/api/doc
alice
http://localhost:8031/api/doc
acme
http://localhost:8041/api/doc

7) create schema and credentials

## create schema

POST: http://localhost:8021/schemas
req: 

{
  "attributes": [
    "firstname","middlename","lastname","age","validfrom", "validuntil", "vaccinations"
  ],
  "schema_name": "vacc-pass-t2",
  "schema_version": "0.0.2"
}
res: 

{
  "schema_id": "RcJY6pShAK5YwZJ55V1cGY:2:vacc-pass-t2:0.0.2",
  "schema": {
    "ver": "1.0",
    "id": "RcJY6pShAK5YwZJ55V1cGY:2:vacc-pass-t2:0.0.2",
    "name": "vacc-pass-t2",
    "version": "0.0.2",
    "attrNames": [
      "middlename",
      "validuntil",
      "vaccinations",
      "firstname",
      "age",
      "lastname",
      "validfrom"
    ],
    "seqNo": 98979
  }
}

## create credential defintion 

POST: http://localhost:8021/credential-definitions

based on the response from the previous step: 
req: 

{
  "revocation_registry_size": 1000,
  "schema_id": "RcJY6pShAK5YwZJ55V1cGY:2:vacc-pass-t2:0.0.2",
  "support_revocation": false,
  "tag": "issuer.vacc.schema2"
}

res:

{
  "credential_definition_id": "RcJY6pShAK5YwZJ55V1cGY:3:CL:98979:issuer.vacc.schema2"
}

## Shutdown Agents

docker stop faber
docker stop alice
docker stop acme
